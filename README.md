# hello-world
Following the git tutorial on creating a repository
I'm working my way through the codecademy web developer course. I'm still early on, I've done the basics of HTML and CSS. They're introducing text editors and recommend learning git for tracking edits and the development of code.

My only previous interaction with github has been when I was getting my 3d printer up and running. I installed Marlin onto a RAMPS board and had to do a fair amount of tweaking in order to get it working properly with my printer. It was good fun, although I just jumped around with trial and error

I did some HTML and visual basic when I was at school. THat was back in the late 90s and before HTML5. I still remember a lot of the HTML basics but the course has filled in a few gaps and brought my understanding up to date a little.

I'm looking forward to diving into javascript as well as looking at things like sql and php futher down the line.

At the moment we're developing an online learning platform at work. We're using moodle and have some better knowledge of HTML and CSS is helping with building that out to look how we'd like it to look.
